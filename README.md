# DungeonAndDragonFightingTools
Project intended to make easier the organization of fights in dungeon and dragons.

Please not that is this software does not contain any "premade" monsters, attacks, etc... it is because my challenge for this software was not to make a D&D implementation, but a D&D tool. I then wanted to create a software that would allow any DM/player to add its very own content into the game.

It is already a very powerful tool for DMs to organize figthts without losing time.
It takes a little time to configure a monster, but once it is done, you can just reuse it everytime you players encounter it.

When you create a character or a monster, you enter every of its characteristics, attacks and etc in order to use them in fights.
An attack could even apply a Status on its target on a DC 15 CON failure for 2 of the victim turns, and inflitc damage on application, all of this automatically applied.

When you get hit a saving throw is asked if you were focused.

I am really trying to make all the little things which you always need to think about during a fight automatic, while allowing the DM to play faster as any rolled dice can be either entered manually (mainly for players, who will likely want to see their dices) or rolled automatically (when a DM plays 10 monster at the same turn).

I am developping this tool while also using it as a DM for the BGDIA campaign, so the functionalities are developed in the order that I need them.

### Roadmap
All Main functionalities that I wanted in 1st version have been implemented, I am now going to a huge serie of refactorization (both save files, architecture and design) before doing a correct user Guide

Other Functionalities will follow such as more conditions to end status etc.. But I don't want to worj on those will I am not 100% satisfied with the curent solution.
