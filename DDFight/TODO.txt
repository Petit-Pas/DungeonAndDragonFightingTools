Change EditCharacterWindow to make it reusable for anything (Generic / inheritance, wtv)

Switch characteristics "names" to enum values

Methods like "Edit Character" (see in NewCharacterWindow.xaml.cs) should be embedded in the CharacterUserControl class for more portable code

Think about a way to implement temporary Hps properly

rename NewCharacterWindow by EditCharacterWindow

In IClonable interface, add a method that replace "this" by the given object
